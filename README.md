# batch
Doing multiple batches at once can be frustrating: flipping through several sheets, losing track of what should be next (you forgot that whole section of back to base, didn't you?), and the batch details having a different order than the signs.

This repo aims to help with all these problems. Upload any number of CSVs, and all items will be ordered by your store mapping, sorted by order code, and combined into one list.
